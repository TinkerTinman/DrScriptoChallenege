Script created by Ed Wilson help memorize PowerShell Cmdlets


This script was originally found at https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/cool-powershell-game-teaches-cmdlet-names/ and was created with the intention of assisting with the memorization of PowerShell Cmdlets by taking all basic Cmdlets and removing 2-6 letters in the output to create blank word spaces.

No input method was created to fill in those blanks, but could be the base concept of a "Fill-in-the-word" game since this script output would create the needed word questions with enough randomization to not allow memorization of questions.
